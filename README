Bash based preprocessor for Java


jpp is simple, at least if you know GNU Bash.
Add lines beginning with # in your Java files,
shebangs are ignored, the rest consists of
directives coded in GNU Bash. An example is
located in ‘test/’. Files named .jpp will be
renamed to end with .java.

In addition to # lines, variables can be included
in a Java code line by placing the name inside
dollar signes inside double quotes that are in turn
in sharp angle brackets. Like this: <"$VARIABLE$">.
‘<"">’ is treated as ‘//’.

Variables are specified when running jpp by -D
(also known as --export) options, the argument
should be as if declared in Bash, the code argument
actually just pasted. Just setting a name in
the argument is mote and can not be used to
declare boolean variables as true.
