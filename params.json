An example is\r\nlocated in ‘test/’. Files named .jpp will be\r\nrenamed to end with .java.\r\n\r\nIn addition to # lines, variables can be included\r\nin a Java code line by placeing the name inside\r\ndollar signes inside double quotes that are in turn\r\nin sharp angle brackets. Like this: <\"$VARIABLE$\">.\r\n‘<\"\">’ is treated as ‘//’.\r\n\r\nVariables are specified when running jpp by -D\r\n(also known as --export) options, the argument\r\nshould be as if declared in Bash, the code argument\r\nactually just pasted. Just setting a name in\r\nthe argument is mote and can not be used to\r\ndeclare boolean variables as true.\r\n\r\n"}
